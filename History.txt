== 0.0.3 (development)
=== Bugfixes
* The rendering output should stay inside HTML <body> tags, so
  as not to trigger quirks mode rendering or any other weirdness.
* jQuery is loaded automatically in case it's not already present,
  rather than just failing.

=== New features
* Works with Rails 3.0 as well as Rails 2.3
* Better variable inspection -- hashes should show up in table-like things.
* You can turn off debug-follows-pointer and scroll around the detail

== 0.0.2 (2011-01-31)
